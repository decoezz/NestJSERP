so i decided to come back to NestJS to enforce my learnings and have more experience with different languages and different coding (typescript) so we will walk through the journey of self learning and utilizing documentation and AI power to try to relearn/remember NestJS

NestJS concepts:
    there is 5 important concepts that NestJS work on that i need to understand and remember to everyone of them to work on any project.First will start with the three most important folders structure.
    1.Modules:
        you can think of the Modules as a group organizer.They define all the services,controllers,imports(all main concepts of a NestJS project).There is always an important root module file called AppModule
    2.Controllers:
        you can think of controllers in NestJS as a combination between routes and controllers in NodeJS.Controllers are used to handle the HTTP requests and can handle the body,params,query decorators(will talk about them later).
    3.Services:
        Services are more like controllers in NodeJS in the way that they handle the actual logic of the function but instead of exporting and importing the functions.They use a NestJS conecpt called Injection where any injected class/function could be called later using decorators
    4.Decorators:
        They are essentinally what makes NestJS special.Think of them as a way to call built in function(or in injected class/function).They are simply called through the @ symbol.There are a lot of decorators in NestJS that we will use through out the project.
    5.Pipes:
        While you might think Pipes are not one of the most important concepts in NestJS.But they will probably be used in most of the project that's why i added them here.Pipes are tools used to convert/validate the data sent from the user to anything we want. for example one of the most famous pipes is called ParseIntPipe used to turn string ID to a number.Also Pipes are used to validate data just like Joi and Zod.
        
Some important notes from the old course:

Nest js is a framework built on top of node js 
Nest js follows the MVC(model view controller) vision

to start a new project we use: nest new nameoftheproject
we run our file using: npm run start:dev

I replaced this part with an extension called NestJS Files that could just right click on explorer part and create any type of file we want
    to create a module for the users we write nest g module users
    to create a controller for users we write nest g controller users
    to create a service for users we write next g service users
we put all our functions logic inside the service and file inject it to the controller file

data transfer object(DTO) schema is the validation that happens before saving the data(like middleware)

we make files with the extension of .dto to identify the file as DTO so we can implement the validators

to make an update schema for the body we use a file that extends PartialType(The main schema)

to add add a validator we use any function we want from the class-validator import { IsEmail,IsEnum,IsNotEmpty,IsString } from "class-validator" and we put the function above the data property

we will use NEON for the database instead of mongodb and we will use Prisma for something called ORM

neon is a postgres sql database which we could say it's a mix between the nosql in the coding way and more like sql in the way of working inside the database 

ORM(object-Relational Mapping):
    -it's a way to comminucate with the sql/relational database using object relational code instead of raw sql code. we could call it a tranformer that changes from normal relational table to classes and objects.rows become instances and columns become properties

benefits of using prisma that i will need to use in the future:
    -Type saftey queries
    -simplified Database operations
    
now to intialize prisma we use the command : npx prisma init

now we will get the folder called prisma and inside it is schema.prisma which will contain all the configuration needed for the database.
now to link between prisma and neon all we have to do is just put the link of the neon connection string into the configuartion file in the url part.

important note: schema.prisma is also the folder where we will define our models/data

defining data models in postgresql is important as it allows as to set the data models and types of data that will be saved to the database

we do that in the schema.prisma file using the word model and we treat it the same way we treat classes in other programming languages for example:
model Employee{
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String 
  role String
  email String @unique
}

now after we do our thing and define some data we use mirgation in cli to migrate the neon with prisma using the following command:npx prisma migrate dev --name init

now everything is migrated and synced we can start playing with our database using prismaservice.ts file

we then import the following to get access to the prisma library:
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
another important step is making sure the class inherts and implements all the follwoing : export class PrismaService extends PrismaClient implements OnModuleInit,OnModuleDestroy{}

OnModuleInit is used to intialize a connection
OnModuleDestroy is used to disconned from a connection 
now we need to make sure the class has a constructor that intialize all the function

after we finised intializing the class we start working in the module file

in the module file we import the class we just created and make sure we specify that our class is going to be the one providing providers(as the place that provides with data/model) and exports(as the one where the data will be exported to): 
@Module({
    providers: [PrismaService],
    exports:[PrismaService]
})
now to save the schema changes to our prisma we use :npx prisma generate

to start with our application/code we need to remember that nestjs require three important files:module,service,controller

the work flow starts by working in the service(define what the function will do) file then controller(will define the GET,POST like route file) then the module(where you will define the controllers:[] and providers)

we always need to remmeber that in the service file we also work in the class and do all work inside a class so we will always need a constructor and because we are using prisma we will intialize an object of prisma so we can get access to the functions of the prisma class :     constructor(private prisma:PrismaService) {}

after we define the constructor we can define any function we want but make sure it's an async function for example:
    async createEmployee(name : string,role :string,email:string,id: number){
        return this.prisma.Employee.create({data:{name,role,email,id}})
    }

now we run back to the Controller to define our function so they can be called using methods like GET,POST

make sure you import the following so you can use them in controller : 
import { Controller,Get,Post,Body } from '@nestjs/common';

we use the same way in the service.ts file and we create a constructor so we get access to all the functions of the EmployeeService file but this time we define the object to be readonly so that it can't be turned into another object:     constructor(private readonly Employee:EmployeeService){}

to define a function with a body we do something like this :
    @Post('CreateEmployee')
    async createEmployee(@Body() body:{name:string,role:string,email:string,id:number}){
        return this.Employee.createEmployee(body.name,body.email,body.role,body.id)
    }
    
i will still work on the idea of validation and limitation but for now this will do.

it looks like the extension i'm using to create nestjs file is causing a little bit of trouble because it imports everything directly into the app.module file which causes problems so if i get an error after creating new files i need to make sure that nothing was added to the app.module

to define the name of the routes in the controller we go to the decortaor and add the name of the route like the following : @Controller('employees')

same thing with the other methods:   @Get('getAllEmployees')

if we want to send an error message when something unexpected happens we use: throw new HttpException('message',HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)

i think for now that will be a good amount of error debugging and handeling

we need to always remember to await all the operations done on the database since it's still like node.js in it's core (one threaded)

so i wanted to create an update user function but the issue i had is that i wanted the data provided from the request body to be optional and to achieve this we will work on one of the concepts we talk about in the start which is dto

so we create a new .dto.ts file and import the class-validator so we can do all the magic we need to validate the data

so i already had some kind of knowledge that we need to identify the name in the following way : name?:string but i needed to do this in a dto file/class and use class-validator

we need to use this line inside main.ts file to enable validation :app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ transform: true }));

so to make the update helper function more modular and usable for other models to use i used an AI agent to help me create a function that works on any model all you have to do is send the prisma service, id of the item,the optional data and the model name

    async updateEmployee(id:number,name?:string,email?:string){
        return updateEntity(this.prisma.employee,id,{name,email},'Employee')
    }

when working on the modelling part inside the schema.prisma file we work in a special language that is called prisma schema it looks like a mix of sql and a little bit of js anyway there is a lot of important decorators that we will use like (@unique,@default or even optional through String? data type) and will use different types of relations like (@relation which could have multiple data fields like fields,reference) for now we will stick to the basics and work with minimal relations

we use npx prisma studio  to visualize our sql database and preform  operations

we also use the following command in terminal to add a new table into our database : npx prisma migrate dev --name add-product-table

sometimes the database might glitch a little bit but it's okay just try to work on the npx prisma migrate dev --name add-product-table command and try to take care of sensitive case keys

when identifing a route that will accept a parameter we need to define that in our @Get decorator for example :  @Get('GetProduct/:modelnumber')

todday i got the idea to start working on cookies and user authentication and i don't have a clue on how it's done in nestjs but i hope i can figure it out

we start with   app.use(cookieParser()) in main.ts since it's kind of middleware so it looks like i will use something more custom called fastify and it will help me more than the normal cookies parser and i will make a custom decorator to access the cookies from the user 

so cookie parser gives us access to the user/website cookies through the req.cookies 

to start off we need to actually define what is a user since all i defiened was employee so a user will be a part of an employee but will have username and password

so i will edit a little bit in the employee model so i give it a new form of id that will look like this :   @@id(name:"Employee",fields: [firstname,lastname]) and now userid will be an id that is default incremented id

when we use something like @@id it's called composite primary key so now it's not a normal field which might cause some problems for example in my case when i try to make a relation between User and Employee and use the @@id as a key for the relation i face a problem and that is @relation needs a field that is either primary/unique or existing

so grok helped me find a solution to that problem that is to manual adjust the EmployeeId through the following : employee         Employee @relation(fields: [employeeFirstname, employeeLastname], references: [firstname, lastname]) and now to the enforce the relation of one to one with Employee we use the following line :   @@unique([employeeFirstname,employeeLastname])


after applying the new changes using : npx prisma migrate dev --name add-user-model and using npx prisma generate after that to confirm the new changes and start working on the new changes

just to remember that we always use a .dto.ts file to verify any kind of data coming from user even the login data we use a .dto file to confirm that an email and a password are sent

so i think we need to rethink a little bit about the logic in the signup/create User and what is the relation between user and employee so i think that only the Inventory_Manager can create Employee or Store_Manager and then after Inventory_Manager creates a user after that the Employee/Store_Manager can go ahead and create a User using the employee email that the Inventory_Manager will give to the Employee and the employee can create a username and password normally

so after outlinning our goals and target we will start by creating forcing the creation of Inventory_Manager through a file called seed.ts

so i need to adjust most of the function and controllers since i changed the structure of the emoployee model but i will change it later for now i will comment it and fix it later

so we will use passpowrt library for authentication

for example if we use  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt'),RolesGuard) in the controller it ensures that a jwt cookies will be sent with the response and we can create a custom decorator to limit the access so that only a specific role can use the function   @Roles('Inventory_Manager')


in the service part to start the creating token and verifing the tokens in the signup or login we start with creating a jwtService object in the constructor just like the prismaService 

the jwt options and setting are done in a file called jwt.Strategy file and this file contains all the options like the Expirations the payload and the secretKey

to use .env variables inside nestjs there is multiple ways but the most convient way is to use dotenv 

so to make a revision of how a token is made:
    -a token consists of three parts: Header,Payload,Signature
    -Header consists of the algorithm used and type of token
    -Payload: consists of some data that we define for example in our program the payload consists of :user.userid,username,role
    -Signature is the way that the program confirms the token has the secret key to confirm that the token is legit
    
an important remark that in the future when working with user data i need to include the employee data with and that is done through the find command we add {include:{employee:true}}

so i faced a problem that is i wanted to create some helper functions to check for existing uesr using different fields like name,email,username while this approach is good the bug i faced is that to access the prismaService you need to intialize it as a function while i wanted to make it in a spereate file i couldn't export is as a function i needed a more complex solution

i thought the solution to this problem was to create another class and inherit(one of oop most known concepts) the functions from it but my ai agent suggested that it is better to use a more nestjs solution and that is called composition


So composition is in it's core "Custom Injectable decorator" and it's basically the same as a helper function that can be used through out the whole project

composition in the end of it is just the same as modules and services that are Injectable so they can be provided in anyplace but as a code it's a just a class that has all the functions we need

the important part is adding the new UserHelper in the module file , after this step you can intialize an object from the class in the constructor just like any class/Injectable

so one of the annoying errors that i didn't really know is that when we hash a password it returns a promise and not a string so in the password field i was trying to pass it as a string but in reality it's a promise to fix this error we use a specified library of bcrypt that is used for typeScript
